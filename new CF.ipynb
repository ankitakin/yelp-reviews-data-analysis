It's obviously smaller than larger stadiums, and the crowd is much smaller.  But there's lots of pros here, including: (1) proximity to the field; (2) cost of tickets; (3) good food and drinks; and (4) no parking hassle.\\n\\nI paid $10 per ticket for bleacher seats that were still really close to the field.  Actual seats were $3 or $4 more per ticket.  It's much easier to see (and be engaged in) the game.  I felt like I could see the player's expressions.  I love that!!!  Much better than being in nosebleed.  (Which is basically non-existent at Cashman.) \\n\\nThey also have a good food selection for a sporting event, i.e., there's not just one or two $10 burger or hot dog options.  Here, there was lots of hot dog options, hamburgers, pretzels, fries, etc.  They also sell shaved ice for $5, which really hits the spot in the heat.  \\n\\nAlso, while there was quite a bit of people when we went it wasn't a PITA to get out of the parking lot after the game.  Big plus with not spending an hour trying to get out of the stadium!\\n\\nIncidentally, parking was $4 for non-season ticket holders and there was plenty of parking.\\n\\nI honestly (and surprisingly) had a great time (I kinda thought it'd be like a high school baseball game, which it wasn't -- at all).

To this day I still enjoy swinging by with my wife or buddies to catch a ballgame and just relax in the warm summer nights with a cold Dr Pepper and hot dog mmmm.

Easy access off the I-515/US-95 with Las Vegas Blvd or I-15 via Washington, or ride RTC Transit route 113 or 208 to get dropped off right in the cultural corridor and skip the traffic and parking fees.

The park is small so not really any bad seats.  Couple years ago we went to the 51's Big League Weekend and saw Cubs v Rangers.  I thought the tickets were kinda pricey for a preseason game in a minor league park ($50ish a ticket).  Along with the tickets we got a voucher for a free ticket to another game during the season so that helped with the price a little.  It was fun to do once but now we just stick to 51's games.

They actually shift their entire outfield toward left field since our two lefty's can't hit to right. If one of our lefty's could shank it down the right field line we'd have scored a few runs rather than leaving men on base. \\n\\nIt is super hard for me to accept that these kids really want to be major leaguers.\\n\\nHow can you be a lefty and let them give you right field and you cannot hit it there?\\n\\nDoes this team need better batting coaches? Or an entirely new management team? \\n\\nThen you have the manner-less left fielder. On cancer awareness night each player ran out to their positions with a cancer survivor. Of course, most walked because the cancer survivor with them could not run. Except snobby left fielder who ran, not giving one hoot about the cancer survivor that he was suppose to escort. What is wrong? Did he not get the memo? So the left fielder SPRINTS out into left field and the cancer survivor walked out alone. Super tacky.\\n\\nThis team is super sloppy I sure hope when they re-brand this team and move to their new field in Summerlin they clean this team up. \\n\\nGo to a game and see one of these guys strike out and throw their bat and throw their helmet and then walk to their position while someone else cleans up their mess and brings them their glove.

Don't go to the game with a friend and expect to chat and converse between innings because the woman yelling, ugh -- you get it. Can we have a few innings of peace?

With our Yelp event here, it was time for me to get back into the summer pastime and enjoy a ball game.\\n\\nThe 51s have never been strong contenders for league winners.  They have been affiliated with the Dodgers, the Blue Jays, and now the Mets.  Except for the facts that the 51s won the other night, what fascinated me the most was seeing the \"bottoms up\" beer machine which was right below where I was sitting.  \\n\\nIt was $1 beer night, so there were a number of people coming by.  I asked Jared N. and Anthony M. how the thing worked.  A short lesson later, I was watching the little magnet being pushed up as the kindly barmaids pushed the cups onto the filler.  Fantastic!  \\n\\nThere have been some rumors that the 51s will be re-branding and using a different name and a new theme.  The team has been sold and the new owners want to build a new stadium a block from where I live.  Gone may be the Area 51 reference in their name and the mascot, Cosmo.

This review is only on the 51's not Cashmen field that will come \\nlater. This is also just for this years club it wouldn't be fair to lump them with past years rosters and management. \\nThe 51's formerly Las Vegas Stars are a triple A franchise of MLB's Toronto Blue Jays. This relationship will likely end soon as the travel distance between the two is cost prohibitive. There has also been a fair amount of discussion of a name change though not since the early stages of new ownership in 2008-09 season. It is believed that new ownership is shopping four a fourth affiliate (Padre's and Dodger's were the previous clubs) to carry the 51's through the next decade. An emphasis on a west coast following is a top priority for the search as is or should be long term commitment of growth in the market. \\nThe first game I attended this year was great a come from behind victory against The Fresno Grizzlies. The 51's spotted The Grizz three runs in the first before we even made it to our seats. The 51's answered back with two in the bottom of the 1st. Then after giving up two more in the top of the fifth the Alien bats broke loose for 5 runs in the bottom half to take a lead that they would not relinquish. \\nThis game was very entertaining from a fans point of view and moved well with very few pitching changes in the late innings. The 51's at the time were in sole possession of first place in their division the are now in sole possession of the basement! It is often said that the measure of a triple A team is more about the quality of player sent to The Show to bolster the parent club especially late in the season. While that is a great notion it would also be nice to put an entertaining product on the field from week to week as well. We shall see as the long season progresses as to how well our friends from Toronto take care of us. I hope to see all the YELPERS on the 3rd for our 51's outing. SYOY\",\n",

While they don't always win when I am there and they don't always perform well over the duration of the season, they always put on a good show.  And when they do win it is extra special.  The last game I went to ended with a score of 19-2 for the Las Vegas 51s over the Reno Aces.  That was a rather convincing win.  It was good to see the home town boys do so well.

       " 'HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q': '5 Having lived in Vegas for 2 years I\\'d heard of the 51\\'s but had never attended one of their games. That changed when a friend\\'s daughter\\'s dance studio was invited to participate in a presentation on the field before the game and to be on the field for the singing of God Bless America during the 7th inning stretch. I went to show my support (there were 30 of us), and for $12 I had one of the best experiences I\\'ve had in Vegas to date. \\n\\nFirst some tips: 1: If you\\'ve never been to Cashman Field before, look for ways to approach the place from the West or Northwest. Yes that takes you past some homeless camps and into a \"sketchy\" part of town. Lock your doors, suck it up, and be thankful that you can afford baseball tickets instead of living in a tent by a railroad overpass. \\n2: Parking in the State Office Building parking lot to the North of Cashman Field was free! It\\'s not that bad of a walk to the field...but if it was a 115 degree day it could be a little rough. \\n3: Bring Cash. The ATM lines were loooooooooooong. (I was prepared and got to skip the lines). \\n4: Some vendors are cash only. But the 1st Base and 3rd Base Grills take debit cards and oh yeah, you don\\'t have to sign any charge slips. Many places in Vegas could learn a thing or two from Aramark on how to handle debit card transactions. \\n5: Be prepared to wait in line if you want a beer as the beermen don\\'t frequently walk the aisles like you see in a major league park. \\n6: There are a handful of enthusiastic fans in the park that for some people are obnoxious with their \"Let\\'s Go 51\\'s\" chants and their attempts to start the wave. But if you\\'ve been to a MLB game, you will welcome their energy and enthusiasm and it will leave you smiling from ear to ear. It\\'s part of the experience and it\\'s good to see it at the Triple A level. \\n\\nOverall I had a blast, even though the Tacoma Rainiers put the game out of reach by the end of the 1st inning with 5 runs on the board. Between innings there were all sorts of on field activities. And the crowd of 9000+ was plenty of fun to be around and made for an exciting atmosphere. This place was VERY KID FRIENDLY too! And the players put on a good performance. At times I felt like I was watching major league ball...but the occasional error like a dropped glove reminded me that some of these players still have some work to do to make it to the big time. And seeing a work in progress that could go on to be a big name someday can be rewarding in it\\'s own right. \\n\\nThings I wished Cashman Field had: A better video board with replays. Better player stats on screen. And better food offerings. I understand Cashman Field\\'s kitchen limitations and they do their best to offer the limited product lineup that they do. But what they lack in selection they make up for in service....the lines at the 3rd Base Grill were long but they moved pretty fast. \\n\\nOverall...if you get the chance to go, and it\\'s not 115 degrees outside the Las Vegas 51\\'s are worthy of your hard earned money and your time to check them out. There are a million different ways to blow the price of a 51\\'s ticket in this city, but few will give you the entertainment value that the 51\\'s will. \\n\\n5 Stars.

Going to a game is always fun for us, if you haven't tried it, you should!\",\n",
       " 'nPDFmoDt6hKkb7TbDHLGVQ': \"4 So this year we splurged and got season tickets in the park's restaurant lounge. Our ticket rep was able to get us the second row table right behind home plate which allows for some great views. \\n\\nPositive - First of all the staff, they are great!!!!! I almost felt like I was hanging out with a fellow baseball fan and had some great conversations. Having our own amenities made you feel your were getting the VIP treatment. We get the radio broadcast feed in the lounge so we can keep with with what is happening since we cannot hear the park announcers. Seating was old but comfortable and having free range of the lounge it was easy to get up and stretch your feet without disturbing anyone.\\n\\nWith the team moving next year, I will just briefly mention that its a good thing as the park could use a refresh. The other concern I have was with the buffet. I thought the food could have been a little better for the price, everything was kinda salty. But you do have options for ala carte or can go and grab concessions so there are other options.\\n\\nIn closing, I am looking forward to hanging out with some great people and getting to know the staff and I am excited to see the new park\",\n",

The Blue Jays on the other hand draw little interest in Las Vegas. \\n\\nPositives: Every seat is a good one.  The ball is usually flying in the heat, there is a chance to see future stars at AAA level and we have seen Roger Clemens watching his son Kobe.\\n\\nNegatives: HEAT - the stadium does little to alleviate the heat\\n                Entertainment:  The ugly donkey looking alien mascot does next to nothing and the pizza mascots even less.  There is no kids play area.\\n                Food - with the exception of the buffet on the club level that no one knows about unless they enter the club level, the food here is boring, bare minimum baseball fare. \\n\\nI am spoiled coming from the single A Lake Elsinore Storm where Thunder entertains fans between each inning, circulates the crowd the rest of the game and the ownership is committed to keeping the crowd entertained.\\n\\nIt is baseball and I love it but the product could use a makeover.',\n",

It\\'s nostalgia.  It\\'s Americana.  It\\'s good ol\\'fashioned fun.  Some people go to watch the game, but I go to hear the crack of a wooden bat and the pop in the catcher\\'s mitt.  Eat some stadium nachos and drink a few brews!  Spend time with friends and family.\\n\\nI went to my first game here in 1986!  They were the Stars back then.  I have seen players like; Santiago, Alomar, Alomar, Konerko, Werth, Victorino.  Seen quite a few major leaguers on rehab; Gagne, Garciapara, Ramon Martinez... Et al.  I was driving home from work one day and a buddy called me and said Lasorda was sitting behind the plate - so I drove down there I saw Lasorda!  (He slept for 2 innings)\\n\\nA couple of years ago \"Hu\" was on first! Or was he on second?  What was on second - Hu was at short... something like that.  \\n\\nSince the Dodgers Left - the place has gone down hill some.  Trust me - nobody gives a rats ass about the Blue Jays farm system.  Of course I say that as a Dodger fan... The grass used to be as green as any major league stadium, but it is looking more like a JR high field.  Oh, and BTW - \"The 51\\'s\" is the dumbest name for a sports team.  I still call them the Stars!\\n\\nIn reality - most people go to the games just to get out and do something fun.  Watching the game just gives us something to fall back on.  This place lacks that minor league park charm though.  Most minor league teams do something quirky for an attraction.  I suggest a few things; bring in some food vendors like some of these food trucks, better give aways, get some local celebs down there or really anything new. \\n\\nCan we get Wayne Newton down there to sing, \"take me out to the ball game???\"\\n\\nI do like dollar beer night!  That is a good time to go people watching.  I have been going there for dollar beer night since I turned 21!\\n\\nThis is the best place in Vegas to catch the Fourth of July fireworks!\\n\\nIt is easy to get to and parking is a cinch.  Close to downtown, Jerry\\'s Nugget and the world famous Palomino Club!\\n\\nThis review is a bit of a mixed bag but, this is a MUST for Las Vegans.  It is Baseball.  The venue, who is on the field and who wins... who cares.  It\\'s baseball.',\n",

Not a lot of people at the game, probably only 25% occupancy.  Tickets are still very cheap, but we generally spend another $25 per person on food, drinks, and snacks.

The sun usually goes down about 30 minutes after the game starts so the weather is nice. You can get great seats pretty cheap ($15) even if you only get there 5 minutes early. They have lots of giveaways (bobble-heads, hats, jerseys) fireworks nights, and most importantly $1 menu Mondays!\\n\\nOk, so the food on $1 menu nights, is not great, but somehow, getting 4 hot dogs, peanuts, a pretzel, and cracker jacks for $7 makes you feel like you've won a freaking jackpot, lol. My husband and I will just sit and shove this crap in our face, watch some great (or sometimes not so great) baseball and feel like all is right with the world. \\n\\nI love seeing all the old timer baseball fans there, and how they know all the employees and security and for a little bit you don't really feel like you are in Vegas anymore or at least you are in a friendlier Vegas...unless you go on $1 beer nights....then you're on you're own!\",\n",

Yes it's minor league but it's triple A which is literally one step below the majors. This is where young players stop before being called up or where veteran players come down for injury rehab/or to sharpen their skills more. Cash man field isn't the greatest stadium but it's more than adequate. All staff from ticketing to ushers to concessions have all been friendly and accommodating in all the times I have visited. This is pretty much the only team that has survived being a sports franchise in Vegas over the years. Been around since the 80s. Hopefully they keep it up. It's family friendly and they deserve to have the support of Vegas residents.\",\n",

Maybe during the one or two weeks we get rain but otherwise they should be on every day. But I digress; \\n\\nThe hidden gem is the club house upstairs; the general admission ticket prices gets you into it; there you can watch the game from an AC skybox; get there early buy the buffet and find a seat with a view it will blow you away to watch a game in a comfortable temp.\",\n",

I've been to numerous games already and I'll keep coming as this is the only way I will get my dose of baseball fix. The stadium gets pretty packed for the games, must be the decent hot dogs or very tasty nachos you can get in a souvenir 51s hat. The ballpark offers many other food options and libations. They also have pretty good promotions like $1 beer nights, value menu Monday's, fireworks every month and other kewl goodies to show off your love of the 51's. \\n\\nThe ballpark is kept really clean during the games, the workers here are very friendly from the concession workers to the ushers, and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. Prices for seats are more than reasonable so if you're looking for a fun time without breaking the bank, head on out to a ballgame. Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, you'll be mad if you never go back, cause you'll want to root, root, root for our home team and when they don't win its a shame.
